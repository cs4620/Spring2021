# Graduate Course Project

## Introduction

If you are taking this course as a graduate course (CSCI 8626), you are required to do additional work so this course can count as graduate credit.

Students who are *not* taking this course for graduate credit will roughly follow this pattern when they work on sprints:


|Beginning of Semester|	Middle of Semester |	End of Semester|
|---|---|---|
|3D Representation (Blender)|	Ray Tracing	|Shaders|

Students enrolled in CSCI 8616 will roughly follow this pattern:


|Beginning of Semester|	Middle of Semester |	End of Semester|
|---|---|---|
|3D Representation (Blender)|	Ray Tracing	| Shaders |
| Start Grad Project | Complete Grad Project | Complete/Finalize Grad Project |


## Start Grad Project

Select a topic for your graduate project. It needs to be related to computer graphics. The more excited you are about the project, the easier everything will be.

Picking a topic is the part of the project that students often struggle the most with. Here is my suggestion:
- Go to https://kesen.realtimerendering.com/sig2020.html. This page has a list of papers at the most recent (and prestigious) graphics conference. Many of the papers have a link to a video. Either review abstracts or look at videos until you find something you would enjoy exploring.
- Once you have a topic, look at the paper and see if there is a part of this paper that you could reasonably implement in <16 weeks.
- If you find a part of a paper that you can implement, get to work!
- If the paper is too complex or there is not a part that you can reasonably do, repeat the following
   - Look at the references at the end of the paper. Find one that seems related and interesting.
   - Look at this paper for a portion that you can reasonably complete.

Normally students need to go back two or three papers before they find something that is reasonable to implement. Through the entire process, I am here to help you. You should have a project planned by the end of January.

## Complete Grad Project

Implement the portion of the academic article you have selected. Get feedback from the professor during sprint time.

## Complete/Finalize Grad Project

Finish your implementation. Prepare a demo reel about your project (~1 minute). You will include this in your final presentation.
