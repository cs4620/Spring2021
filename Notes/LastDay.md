# Final Thoughts

## Final Rubric

### Presentation Quality
- On time
- Appropriate length
- The video is well prepared
- The presentation has been practiced
- The presentation is coherent, positive, and directed to the audience

### Project Quality
Full points for having all the following and showing mastery in two:

- Modeling
- Shading (in Blender)
- Keyframe animation
- Rigging (armature)
- Ray Tracer
- GPU Shading

### A not about GPU shading

We did not have as much time to talk about GPU shading as I had planned. My expectation is that you do some exploration on your own that involves writing or changing the code of a GPU shader. For example, take some of the examples from class and modify them to demonstrate that you can understand the basics.
